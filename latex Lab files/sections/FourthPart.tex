\section{Fourth Member}
%This is the section dedicated to one of the team members, and it should be written individually . It can include a range of things; first subsection is a space for you to point out the strengths and weaknesses of the module, including complaints about the module coordinator Max Wilson. The second section should have a selfie image with Max! The last part of it is the most important one. You will need to write a paragraph about what you have learned in this module. You can write it in \textbf{Bold} if you want or you can use other fonts. 

%Please do not forget:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item First paragraph should have your comments about the module
%	\item Second one, a selfie img with Max
%	\item Last one, what you learned in this module.
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comments about the module}
Seems helpful for the future. Interesting most of the time ("most of the time" due to content, lecturer is damn cool, although he looks sort of disappointed in the following picture). Apart from the not-perfect content (for me at least), the module is well taught, the pace is excellent and lecture quality reaches the level of Gordon Ramsey's cooking ["Welcome, tributes, to A32 - Hell's Laboratories"]. NEED I SAY MORE?!

\subsection{Selfie with Max}

\begin{figure}[h]

%You can then use the label of the figure to reference it later with the command ${\backslash}ref$. you can comment out the next line to see an example of how it works.

% My selfie with Max is in  Figure~\ref{fig:selfie}.

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
A bunch of useful stuff, mostly including teamwork and a whole series of engineering steps that replaced my concept of just hacking code together and praying to whichever available deity that it will work.
Also here are two smiley to compensate for sad/disappointed Marlin (Nemo-dad) Max.
