\subsection{Comments about the module}
I really enjoyed learning about JUnit, because I believe that TDD is a very importan and the way forward. I can't say that I dislike anything about Max, since even though the module is at times less interesting than some other modules, he has managed to make it quite interesting. I also enjoyed learning about LaTeX, since I do not really like MS Word and have previouosly written files in Markdown which is like a simple version of LaTex. I also liked that we learn about Git, even though I know quite a bit about it already. The common theme between the things that I like about this modeule is the practical skills that I can immediately apply somewhere else.
